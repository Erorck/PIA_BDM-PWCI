            <p>Joven Mexicano gana beca para estudiar en la NASA ciencia aeroespacial y astrofisica </p>
            <hr>
            <p>I just made something unexpected
                Something sharp
                Something new
                It's not symmetrical or perfect
                But it's beautiful
                And it's mine
                What else can I do?
                
                Bring it in, bring it in
                (Good talk!) Bring it in, bring it in
                What else can I do?
                (Let's walk!) Bring it in, bring it in
                (Free hugs!) Bring it in, bring it in
                
                I grow rows and rows of roses
                Flor de mayo by the mile
                I make perfect, practised poses
                So much hides behind my smile
                
                What could I do if I just grew what I was feeling in the moment?
                (Do you know where you're going? Whoa!)
                What could I do if I just knew it didn't need to be perfect?
                It just needed to be, and they let me be?
                
                A hurricane of jacarandas
                Strangling figs (Big!)
                Hanging vines (This is fine)
                Palma de cera fills the air as I climb
                And I push through
                What else can I do?
                
                Can I deliver us a river of sundew?
                Careful, it's carnivorous, a little just won't do
                
                I wanna feel the shiver of something new
                I'm so sick of pretty
                I want something true, don't you?
                
                You just seem like your life's been a dream
                Since the moment you opened your eyes
                (How far do these roots go down?)
                All I know are the blossoms you grow
                But it's awesome to see how you rise
                How far can I rise?
                Through the roof to the skies
                Let's go
                
                A hurricane of jacarandas (Woo!)
                Strangling figs (Go!)
                Hanging vines (Grow!)
                Palma de cera fills the air as I climb
                And I push through
                What else, what else?
                
                What can you do when you are deeply, madly, truly in the moment?
                (Seize the moment, keep going)
                What can you do when you know who you wanna be isn't perfect?
                But I'll still be okay
                Hey, everybody clear the way (Woo!)
                I'm coming through with tabebuia
                (She's coming through with that buia!)
                Making waves (Making waves)
                Changing minds (You've changed minds)
                The way is clearer 'cause you're here and, well
                I owe this all to you
                What else can I do?
                
                Show 'em what you can do
                What else can I do?
                There's nothing you can't do
                What else can I do?

            <p>We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
                We don't talk about Bruno, but
                
                It was my wedding day
                It was our wedding day
                We were getting ready
                And there wasn't a cloud in the sky
                No clouds allowed in the sky
                Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin
                Thunder
                
                You telling this story or am I?
                I'm sorry, mi vida, go on
                
                Bruno says "It looks like rain"
                Why did he tell us?
                In doing so, he floods my brain
                Abuela gets the umbrellas
                Married in a hurricane
                What a joyous day but anyway
                
                We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
                We don't talk about Bruno
                
                Hey, grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
                I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
                I associate him with the sound of falling sand
                It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling
                Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
                Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
                Do you understand?
                
                A seven-foot frame, rats along his back
                When he calls your name it all fades to black
                Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams
                
                We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
                We don't talk about Bruno
                
                He told me my fish would die, the next day: dead (No, no)
                He told me I'd grow a gut, and just like he said (No, no)
                He said that all my hair would disappear, now look at my head (No, no)
                Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read
                
                He told me that the life of my dreams
                Would be promised and someday be mine
                He told me that my power would grow
                Like the grapes that thrive on the vine
                (Oye, Mariano's on his way)
                
                He told me that the man of my dreams
                Would be just out of reach, betrothed to another
                It's like I hear him now
                Hey sis, I want not a sound out of you
                It's like I can hear him now, I can hear him now
                
                Bruno
                Yeah, about that Bruno
                I really need to know about Bruno
                Gimme the truth and the whole truth, Bruno
                (Isabela, your boyfriend's here)
                Time for dinner
                
                A seven-foot frame, rats along his back
                (It was my wedding day, it was our wedding day)
                When he calls your name it all fades to black
                (We were getting ready and there wasn't a cloud in the sky)
                Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams
                (Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin)
                Thunder
                You telling this story or am I?
                
                Oye, Mariano's on his way
                Bruno says, "It looks like rain"
                (He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach)
                In doing so, he floods my brain
                (Betrothed to another, another)
                Married in a hurricane
                (I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine)
                He's here
                
                Don't talk about Bruno, no
                Why did I talk about Bruno?
                Not a word about Bruno
                I never should have brought up Bruno.
